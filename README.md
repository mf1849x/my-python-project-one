# My Python Project One

This project contains Python scripts that interact with the OpenAI API to perform different tasks.

## Features

-   **`basic-ai.py`**: This script uses the OpenAI API (specifically the `gpt-4.1` model) to generate a three-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn. It demonstrates a basic text generation capability.
-   **`websearch.py`**: This script utilizes the OpenAI API (specifically the `gpt-4o-mini` model) along with a web search tool. It takes the input "Tell me about ai agents" and is expected to use web search capabilities to provide an informed response.


Make sure your `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set before running the scripts.
